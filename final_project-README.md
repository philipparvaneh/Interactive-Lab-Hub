# Final Project
# TEAM: WHERE'S BIG RED?
# MEMBERS: Lineker Ono-Lozano, Tony Wan, Ravi Niteesh Voleti


Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 15

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 17

Functional check-off - November 29 & December 1

Final Project Presentations - December 6

Write-up and documentation due - December 12


## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.
   --Big Idea: Utilizing our Raspberry Pi devices, we will be creating a working UWB sensor that can mount in a room to pinpoint Big Red's location within that area.
   --Timeline: Order sensor, setup configuration with pi, test signal, run experiment, review results, integrate with a phone, reiterate
   --Parts Needed: 3 UWB sensors (already ordered), raspberry pi
   --Risks/ Contingencies: Power supply, failure to recognize device/users, possible compatibility error
   --Fall-Back Plan: Research other possible UWB sensors to use, use Wifi instead of UWB

3. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.
4. Documentation of design process
5. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
6. Video of someone using your project
7. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)
7. Group work distribution questionnaire
